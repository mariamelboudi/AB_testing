# Welcome to the A/B testing repository !


In this repository you will find my projects that focus on A/B testing.  
For now there is only one project, but more will come soon. Stay tuned !

- [Player retention](https://github.com/mariamelboudi/AB_testing/tree/main/player_retention)
Does moving a gate from level 30 to level 40 increase the likelihood of player retention ?
